# CPSC 8430 HW3
Please find the two files that were used for this homework.

H3.py is a script that loads in training data, tokenizes it, loads in a pre-trained BERT model and fine tunes it for QA
It will create two plots for training loss and F1 score throughout training

HW3_Supp.py includes supporting functions for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

# To run
Both models must be in the same directory as the training and testing data: spoken_train-v1.1.json, spoken_test-v1.1.json
